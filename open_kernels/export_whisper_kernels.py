r"""Build the open Whisper engine's kernel set (issue #72): ONE xclbin carrying an
instruction stream per encoder GEMM shape, plus fa/ (the bidirectional FlashAttention
kernel, NpuEmbeddings task 0181), plus the files the engine reads beside them.

    . C:\dev\mlir-aie\iron_env.ps1          # or: source ~/ironenv142/bin/activate
    python open_kernels/export_whisper_kernels.py [--out DIR] [--only qkv,o] [--force] [--no-fa]

By default the set is written to src/xclbins/Whisper-V3-Turbo-NPU2/open_kernels/ -- the
same place the other open engines' exporters write theirs, which the build tree's
xclbins junction and the install step already cover, so the engine finds it with no
configuration (src/common/whisper/whisper_engine_select.cpp, find_open_kernels).

Each GEMM stream is designs/whisper_gemm/whisper_gemm.py specialised to one (M, K, N) and
built by build_design.py in its own directory. The set is only valid if every stream's
final.xclbin is the SAME static configuration -- the instruction streams are swapped over
one hardware context, so a stream whose core program or DMA topology differed would run
against the wrong one. That is checked, not assumed: fc1 and xkv drain C one row block at
a time (tb_n_rows = 1) and conv2 has K = 3840, so they are exactly the streams that could
diverge. The comparison is npu_offload/gemm_rtp's xclbin_identical_mod_uuid, the one the
embedding exporter already uses.

fa/ is a SEPARATE hardware context (its own xclbin, its own fixed shape -- H=20, dk=dv=64,
lq=lk=1536, valid_len=1500 -- src/open_whisper/fa_attention.hpp's contract), built from
designs/whisper_fa/attn_fa.py the same way, by the same build_design.py, with the same
pinned toolchain -- so the whole kernel set, GEMM and attention alike, now comes from our
own IRON source and never needs a kernel built elsewhere (e.g. AMD's MLIR-AIR toolchain)
copied in. `--no-fa` skips it (the engine then falls back to host attention, OW_ATTN=auto).
It is built into a temporary staging directory and only renamed to <out>/fa/ once every
file in it exists and is verified -- a failed or partial fa build must never leave a
directory at <out>/fa/ that OW_ATTN=auto could pick up and dispatch against.

Output (DIR):
    final.xclbin, insts.bin (= the first GEMM stream), insts_<stream>.bin
    design.json          what open_npue's npu::Design parses (buffers sized for the
                         largest stream), plus the per-stream table
    toolchain.json       which mlir-aie / Peano / git HEAD built it (T39)
    whisper_kernels.json the marker the engine's kernel lookup accepts, with the model
                         geometry it was built for (hf_config_check)
    build/<stream>/      each GEMM stream's own build, kept for the identity evidence
    fa/air.xclbin, fa/air.insts.bin, fa/fa.json   the FlashAttention kernel (see above)
    build/fa/            its own build, kept for the identity evidence
