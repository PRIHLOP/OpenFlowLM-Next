// open_whisper -- OPTIONAL, env-selected precision variants for the host
// decoder (task 0180 Part 8): a per-tensor lever to move fewer bytes without
// changing the decoder's default arithmetic. Every variant is OFF unless its
// env var is set, and the unset (default) path in decoder.cpp is untouched --
// this file adds NEW code paths, it does not edit the old ones.
//
// Deliberately its own translation unit pulling in no XRT and no device (the
// same discipline guards.cpp documents for itself): decoder_quant_test.cpp
// links this file plus open_qwen36/q4nx_file.cpp alone, so every kernel here
// is reachable, and testable against a double-precision reference, without
// hardware or the 1.6 GB container's decoder ever running a device.
//
// Three independent variants:
//
//   OW_DEC_XKV = fp32 (default) | bf16
//     The gathered CROSS K/V (decoder.hpp's xkv_gathered_, set once per 30 s
//     window by Decoder::set_encoder_output()) stored as bf16 instead of
//     fp32. Halves 61.4 MB. Self-attention's own KV cache is untouched --
//     this variant only ever touches the cross side.
//
//   OW_DEC_W = bf16 (default) | int8
//     The eight per-layer linears (self q/k/v/out, cross q/out, fc1, fc2)
//     stored as symmetric int8 with one fp32 scale per OUTPUT row, quantized
//     once at load time from the bf16 weights the container ships. NOT the
//     tied head -- that is OW_DEC_HEAD, below, because the head is read two
//     different ways (a lookup on the input side, a sweep on the output
//     side) and conflating the two would lose the lookup's exactness for
//     free.
//
//   OW_DEC_HEAD = bf16 (default) | int8 | int8x
//     The tied head (embed_tokens read as an output projection: logits =
//     h . embed_tokens^T). The EMBEDDING LOOKUP (token_id -> row) always
//     reads the bf16 table -- only the 51866 x 1280 output sweep is
//     affected.
//       int8:  every logit from the int8 approximation.
//       int8x: every logit from int8, then the K=64 rows with the largest
//              int8-approximate logit are recomputed EXACTLY (the same bf16
//              dot decoder.cpp's default path uses) and overwritten in
//              place. See recompute_top_k_exact()'s own comment for why this
//              keeps greedy argmax exact except in one named failure mode.

// `logits[0, out)` already holds the int8-approximate value for every row.
//
// Every row in [special_begin, out) -- eos/<|endoftext|>, then every
// language, task, no-timestamps and timestamp token -- is recomputed
// EXACTLY, unconditionally, REGARDLESS of its int8-approximate rank (PR #111
// review, finding E). It is not optional: the hf decode protocol's own
// logits processing (generation_hf.cpp's apply_suppress_tokens,
// WhisperTimestampProcessor's log-sum-exp text-vs-timestamp decision, and
// detect_language's language argmax) reads almost exclusively from this
// region, which is only ~3% of the vocabulary (1609 of 51866 rows for this
// geometry) -- far too small a slice to reliably land inside an int8-ranked
// top-64 on its own, so leaving it to the top-K logic below would mean the
// protocol's decisions run on int8 approximations (or on the cap, an even
// coarser placeholder) almost every step.
//
// Among the remaining TEXT rows [0, special_begin), finds the K largest BY
// THE (still int8-approximate) LOGIT, recomputes exactly those K rows with
// dot_bf16_kernel against `w_bf16` (the container's own bf16 bits -- the
// same tensor linear()'s default bf16 path reads), overwrites logits[idx]
// with the exact value + bias[idx] (bias may be null for an explicit zero
// vector, matching the tied head's own no-bias convention), and then CAPS
// every non-recomputed TEXT row at the minimum of the K exact TEXT values
// just computed. Special rows are never capped -- they are already exact.
//
// Why the cap is there (PR #111 review, finding 9): an earlier version of
// this comment argued the argmax stayed exact "whether or not any of the
// other out-K rows' int8 approximations are close" -- that was too strong.
// Capturing the true max within the top K is necessary but not sufficient:
// if the true-max row's OWN int8 approximation happens to OVERESTIMATE its
// true value, its pre-recompute rank sits above where its exact value would
// have placed it, leaving a gap between the (now-exact) corrected max and
// the approximation threshold that decided the top-K cutoff. A row excluded
// from the top K can sit in that gap -- an int8 overestimate of its own --
// and, left uncorrected, that stale value would outrank the exact winner.
// The cap forecloses this: no un-recomputed TEXT row can ever exceed the K
// exact TEXT values, so the post-call argmax is always one of: a row in
// [special_begin, out) (always exact), or one of the K rows this function
// recomputed exactly within [0, special_begin). Capping costs nothing real
// for a row that was never going to be trusted uncorrected either way.
//
// The remaining, DIFFERENT failure mode is unfixed and unfixable by this
// function alone: the true TEXT maximum landing OUTSIDE the int8-ranked
// top-K in the first place, which requires int8 quantization error to have
// pushed the true winner below rank K-1 other TEXT rows, i.e. an error
// larger than the gap between the true max and the K-th largest
// int8-approximate TEXT logit. K=64 is chosen because that gap is,
// empirically (see decoder_quant_test's real-weight measurement), far
// larger than the per-row int8 error this quantization produces -- but it
// is not a proof, which is why this is documented as the named risk rather
// than claimed away. This residual risk does not apply to
// [special_begin, out) at all, since every row there is always exact.
