/// \file core.hpp
/// \brief The resident open-kernel decode engine: device, kernels, weights and
///        per-layer state held for the process lifetime; one `step()` per token.
///
/// The core is an interpreter of the kernel set's manifest.json
/// (manifest.hpp, written by open_kernels/export_qwen36_kernels.py from the
/// family recipe): the contexts and kernels to load, the per-layer buffers to
/// allocate and pack, and per layer TYPE the verb sequence to run --
/// `run <kernel> <buffers...>` and `moeroute2 <kernel>` (read the router's
/// top-k out of `act`, re-point the expert fills) -- then the tail (final
/// norm, lm_head). Kernels marked `attnpos` have their KV window length and
/// row / RoPE-record offsets patched once per token. No model constant lives
/// in this file; a new model in the family is a new manifest.
///
/// This is the host half of the open path that phlegm ran as a batch `.cfg`
/// program and planned as `OpenBackend`. It has no dependency on the OFLM app
/// headers so it can be built and tested on its own (cli.cpp); engine.hpp
/// adapts it to the app's `causal_lm` seam.
///
/// Prefill is decode-as-prefill -- the prompt through `step()` one token at a
/// time, exact for this architecture -- unless the kernel set carries the
/// block route (manifest.hpp's GemmBlockProgram): then `step_gemm_block()`
/// takes 256 tokens at a time through the projections as GEMMs, with the
/// stages between them on the host (block_host.hpp) and, on the MoE
/// families, the expert block still one token at a time.
