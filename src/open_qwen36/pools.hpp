/// \file pools.hpp
/// \brief Pack a layer's weights out of the `.q4nx` container into the byte
///        layouts the open kernels stream, following the manifest's packing
///        plan (open_kernels/recipes/qwen36moe.py `pack_plan`).
///
/// A q4_1 source is not dequantized or requantized: the 5120-byte chunks are
/// copied verbatim, only their ORDER changes, because the AIE array streams a
/// matrix band by band rather than in the file's raster order. The laws are the
/// ones phlegm verified byte-for-byte against pools captured from OFLM's own
/// engine; open_kernels/recipes/pack.py is the same interpreter in NumPy, and
/// specs/open-engine/tests/test_pack_plan.py holds it to the frozen originals.
///
/// A q8 source (8704-byte chunks) is accepted transparently by every q4 op and
/// re-quantized to q4_1 chunk by chunk on the way into the pool
/// (`requant_q4_1_chunks`). The two formats hold the SAME 32-row x 256-column
/// tile, so no chunk index law changes and no plan, manifest or kernel knows the
/// difference -- which is what lets the Qwen3.6-35B fine-tunes (q8 attention,
/// linear-attention and shared experts; q4_1 routed experts) and Qwen3.5's q8
/// `ssm_out_proj` run on kernels that only have a q4_1 GEMV (OPEN-PACK-PLAN).
///
/// A Q4_K source (4736-byte chunks, what OFLM 1.0.3+ writes) is accepted the same way and
/// transcoded to q4_1 (`q4k_to_q4_1_chunks`). That one is nearly free: Q4_K's scale and
/// min already have the pool's granularity and index, so only the two bf16 products
/// round (OPEN-QUANT-Q4K). Any other chunk size is refused, naming the tensor.
///
/// A projection the kernel set streams AT q8 (the manifest carries `q8_perm` instead of
/// `std_perm` for it) is not re-quantized at all: each 8704-byte container chunk is split
/// into two 16-row half-tiles of 5120 bytes -- a byte permutation, no arithmetic -- and
/// those are placed by the q8 band law (four 16-row parts per k-tile instead of two 32-row
/// halves). A container whose tensor is not q8 where the manifest says q8 is refused by
/// name: that is the check that the container agrees with the kernel set (OPEN-QUANT-Q8).
///
/// A GPT-OSS source (2560-byte chunks, 32 rows x 128 columns) is not accepted by the q4 ops
/// at all -- its file raster is a supertile rather than the plain one, so the chunk index law
/// differs as well as the geometry. It has its own op, `std_fuse`, which locates the k-tile's
/// two 128-column halves in that raster and fuses them into one pool chunk by eight byte-slice
/// copies, synthesising an all-zero chunk for a column block past the container's own width --
/// so the fuse and the pad from the container's K to the pool's are one pass (OPEN-PACK-CHUNK-FUSE).
///
/// Ops: std_perm (a standard [out, in] matmul tensor into 64-row band order),
/// std_fuse (the same band order out of half-width chunks in the supertile raster),
/// expert_stripes (routed up/gate as interleaved transposed stripes),
/// expert_down (the routed down slices), put (small weights verbatim),
/// q8_perm (the same tensor kept at q8: 16-row half-tiles in the q8 band order),
/// conv_transpose (conv1d [taps, NCH] -> [groups][taps][width]),
/// lmhead_q8 (the q8 head's 128-row supertiles) and transpose (a small
/// [rows, cols] tensor -> [cols, rows]).
