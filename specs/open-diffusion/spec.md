# Open diffusion: FLUX.2 [klein] 4B text-to-image on the NPU

What the open image engine must do, and what has been measured. Directory name gives the
prefix: `OPEN-DIFFUSION`.

The model is `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B` (distilled, 4 steps, no CFG):
- the DiT has 5 double-stream and 20 single-stream blocks (hidden 3072, 24 heads of 128);
- the text encoder is Qwen3-4B layers 1-27 (taps 9/18/27);
- the VAE decoder is AutoencoderKLFlux2.

**The reference is the diffusers pipeline in bf16 on the CPU**
(`utilities/dit-ref/klein_quant_study.py`, 8 fixed prompts, seed 1234 + i). The goal set
by the user is maximum speed without broken images: drift is acceptable, breakage is
not.

The schedule is one list, `open_kernels/klein_pipeline.py`:
- text encoder, conditioning, 4 steps, VAE;
- 1050 dispatches over six kernel sets.

The exporter builds its streams (`open_kernels/export_dit_kernels.py`). Two runners replay
the same list:
- `utilities/dit-chain/generate.py` (pyxrt);
- `src/open_diffusion/` (native), from the model directory `utilities/dit-chain/export_bundle.py`
  writes (`q4nx-build --open-diffusion`). `oflm image` runs it.

## Requirements

### OPEN-DIFFUSION-NPU-ONLY: no host compute that grows with the data
**Applies to:** `open_kernels/klein_pipeline.py`, `utilities/dit-chain/generate.py`, `src/open_diffusion`, `oflm image`
**Verification:** manual

During a generation the host may do only these things:
- tokenize the prompt;
- gather the prompt's 512 embedding rows;
- write the seeded noise;
- patch `te_attn`'s `valid_len`;
- read the RGBA and encode the PNG or JPEG.

Everything else is an NPU dispatch. The host queues runs within one kernel set and blocks,
without polling, on the last run before switching sets.

**Verification (manual):** run `generate.py` (or the native CLI) on a quiet machine and
compare the process CPU time per image with the NPU wall time. The report prints both
(`host CPU`).

**Measured 2026-09-27** (pyxrt runner): 0.1-0.45 s of host CPU per image, against 6.5-7.4 s
(512²) and 20 s (1024²) of NPU time.

### OPEN-DIFFUSION-QUALITY: not broken, and within the predicted drift
**Applies to:** the whole pipeline
**Verification:** manual

The runner is given the study's fixed noise and prompts (`capture_pipeline_inputs.py`,
`generate.py --study`). Its images must meet all of these:
- they are coherent;
- text prompts render legible text;
- the LPIPS against the bf16 CPU run lands near what the CPU emulation of the NPU
  arithmetic predicts. Materially higher is a bug.

**Verification (manual):**

```
python utilities\dit-chain\generate.py --kernels <set> --size 512 --study C:\dev\ditref-out\goldens_pipe_512 --out <dir>
C:\dev\ditref-venv\Scripts\python.exe utilities\dit-ref\score_images.py <dir> --test "{:02d}.png" --ref "{:02d}.png" --ref-dir C:\dev\ditref-out\klein_512_s4\bf16
```

Then look at the grid.

**Measured 2026-09-27**, 512², 8 prompts, LPIPS vs bf16 (noise floor: fp32 vs bf16 is
0.013):

| run | LPIPS mean / max | CPU-emulated prediction |
|---|---|---|
| DiT + VAE on the NPU, the bf16 text embeddings | 0.044 / 0.092 | 0.029 / 0.081 (DiT linears + attention only) |
| the same with diffusers' exact modulation vectors injected | 0.047 / 0.180 | |
| **everything on the NPU** | **0.107 / 0.191** | te-npu alone: 0.092 / 0.241 |

- All 16 images are coherent. "OPEN LATE" and "SOUP OF THE DAY: TOMATO" render legibly.
- At 1024² (2 prompts) the images are coherent too: LPIPS 0.33 and 0.15. Prompt 0's sign
  moves within the frame.
- The gap to the DiT prediction is the conditioning GEMMs. The study did not emulate
  them: timestep MLP, modulation and embedders. They share dit_gemm's bf16-accumulator
  arithmetic, which puts the modulation vectors 2-3% from diffusers'.
  - Injecting diffusers' exact vectors takes the 7 non-chaotic prompts from 0.038 to
    0.028.
  - Prompt 0 swings either way under any perturbation.
- The rest of the full pipeline's drift is the text encoder's padding rows. That drift
  is known, accepted, and not NPU-specific (`utilities/dit-chain/README.md`).

### OPEN-DIFFUSION-RESOLUTIONS: the supported sizes, and a named refusal for others
**Applies to:** `open_kernels/klein_pipeline.py`
**Verification:** test
**External tests:** none (`specs/open-diffusion/tests/test_host_setup.py`)

A square size R runs only when all of these hold:
- R is a positive multiple of 16 px;
- (R/16)² image tokens is a multiple of 512 (dit_gemm's M tile).

Any other size is refused with the reason named, never run wrong.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- 512 and 1024 pass `check_resolution`.
- 768 is refused because 2304 image tokens is not a multiple of 512.
- 520 and 0 are refused as not a positive multiple of 16.
- `plan(768)` raises.

### OPEN-DIFFUSION-SCHEDULE: the scheduler matches diffusers
**Applies to:** `open_kernels/klein_pipeline.py`
**Verification:** test

The host computes the flow-match sigmas: the exponential time shift with FLUX.2's
empirical mu, and a terminal 0. They must match diffusers' FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler
bit for bit, because a changed sigma changes every image silently. Euler's dt reaches the
NPU as an fp32 in its parameter run.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `sigmas(512)` = [1.0, 0.95808536, 0.88398188, 0.71749657, 0.0] (float32, exact).
- `sigmas(1024)` = [1.0, 0.96738404, 0.90814394, 0.76719993, 0.0].
- `dt_params` stores sigma[s+1] - sigma[s] as the fp32 at the parameter run's first
  vector.

### OPEN-DIFFUSION-CLI: `oflm image` writes one image
**Applies to:** `oflm` (`src/src/image_command.hpp`, `src/include/utils/vm_args.hpp`, `src/include/AutoModel/model_families.hpp`)
**Verification:** manual

`oflm image <tag> "<prompt>" [-o FILE] [--size 512|1024] [--seed N]` writes one image and
prints its path, the seed and the time on the NPU (text, steps, VAE).
- The format comes from the extension: `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`, any case. Any other is
  refused before loading. The default file is `oflm-<seed>.png` in the current directory.
- `--size` defaults to 1024. A size the registry entry's `image_sizes` does not list is
  refused before any download, naming the supported ones.
- `--seed` defaults to a random 64-bit value.
- A tag whose registry entry lacks `"image": true` is refused before any download.
- `-o`, `--size`, `--seed` and a third positional are refused by every other command.
- `oflm run` and `oflm serve` refuse the image tag as not a chat model, before unloading
  anything. `/api/tags` and `/v1/models` do not list it.
- An HRX build answers that `oflm image` is not implemented in this build.

**Verification (manual):**
1. `oflm image flux2-klein:4b "a red fox in fresh snow" --size 512 --seed 1 -o fox.png`:
   a coherent fox; the path, `Seed 1` and a timing line are printed.
2. The same with `-o fox.jpg`: a JPEG of the same image.
3. Each of these fails with the named reason and loads nothing:
   `-o fox.webp`; `--size 768` (supported: 512, 1024); `oflm image llama3.2:1b "x"`
   (not an image model); `oflm run llama3.2:1b --seed 1`; `oflm pull llama3.2:1b "x"`.
4. `oflm run flux2-klein:4b` is refused as not a chat model.

### OPEN-DIFFUSION-TOKENS: oflm's prompt ids equal the pipeline's
**Applies to:** `src/open_diffusion/prompt.cpp`, `src/open_diffusion/engine.cpp`
**Verification:** test

The ids `oflm image` feeds the engine for a prompt equal `klein_pipeline.token_ids`: Qwen3's
chat template with the empty think block kept, tokenized without special tokens,
truncated to 512 after templating. The engine pads them with 151643 and masks keys past
their length. A prompt may itself contain the pad token; the length is the ids' count,
never the first pad.

**Acceptance criteria** (`specs/open-diffusion/tests/token_goldens.json`, written by
`utilities/dit-chain/klein_tokens.py --goldens`):
- The 8 study prompts give the goldens' ids exactly.
- A prompt with accents, CJK and an emoji gives the goldens' 32 ids.
- `"a prompt that names <|endoftext|> inside it"` gives 20 ids with 151643 inside them.
- The empty prompt gives the template's 12 ids.
- A prompt of 400 words gives exactly 512 ids, the goldens' first 512.

Run by the `open_diffusion_tokens` CTest (`src/open_diffusion/tokens_test.cpp`) against
the installed model's `tokenizer.json`; it fails, naming the path, without it.

### OPEN-DIFFUSION-DETERMINISM: same inputs, same bytes
**Applies to:** `src/open_diffusion`, `oflm image`
**Verification:** test

The same prompt, size and seed give the same file bytes, run to run, and the same pixels
as the pyxrt runner.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Two `oflm image flux2-klein:4b "a red fox in fresh snow" --size 512 --seed 1` runs
  write identical PNG files (`specs/open-diffusion/tests/test_cli_determinism.py`; needs
  the NPU, `oflm.exe` and the installed model, and says which is missing when skipped).

### OPEN-DIFFUSION-PACKAGE: the model and its kernels are built and found with no manual step
**Applies to:** `utilities/q4nx-build` (`--open-diffusion`), `open_kernels/export_dit_kernels.py` (`--install`), `src/open_diffusion`, `src/model_list.json`, `src/model_info.json`
**Verification:** manual

- `q4nx-build --open-diffusion -i black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B -o <dir>` builds the
  whole model directory from the checkpoint (flat: 17 files, ~9 GB) and
  `model_info_entry.json`. It refuses a checkpoint whose pipeline class, transformer or
  text-encoder geometry is not klein 4B's, naming the fields.
- `export_dit_kernels.py --install <dir>` copies a built kernel directory's runtime files
  only and writes `diffusion_kernels.json` last. It refuses a directory built from other
  stream specs than the tree's.
- The model directory and the kernel set carry the same layout hash (every stream spec
  and the weight packing). The engine refuses a kernel set whose manifest is missing,
  incomplete, of another format or of another layout, naming which.
- The engine finds its kernels in this order: `OFLM_DIFFUSION_KERNELS_DIR` (used as
  given), `<model dir>/open_kernels`, then `<root>/xclbins/FLUX.2-klein-4B-NPU2/open_kernels`
  for each xclbins root. The installer ships the last.
- `oflm pull flux2-klein:4b` installs the model from `Cyronius/FLUX.2-klein-4B-NPU2`,
  verifying every file's hash.

**Verification (manual):**
1. Build the model directory into an empty models root with `q4nx-build --open-diffusion`;
   `oflm list` shows `flux2-klein:4b` installed.
2. `oflm image` finds the installed kernel set with no variable set (it prints "an xclbins
   root").
3. Point `OFLM_DIFFUSION_KERNELS_DIR` at a copy of the set whose manifest layout is
   edited: refused, naming both hashes.
4. On a machine without the model: `oflm pull flux2-klein:4b` downloads 17 files and
   reports them verified.

**Verified 2026-09-28:** built from `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B` (layout
`e0450140c44f78e0`) and uploaded to `Cyronius/FLUX.2-klein-4B-NPU2`. The live tree
listing matched the builder's predicted registry entry for all 17 files. `oflm pull`
into an empty models root verified all 17 hashes, and the pulled model's 512² seed-1 fox
has the same bytes as the locally built one. `oflm image` found the shipped kernel set
with nothing set ("an xclbins root"). A manifest with an edited layout was refused,
naming both hashes.

### OPEN-DIFFUSION-PERF: what may be called a performance number
**Applies to:** the whole pipeline
**Verification:** manual

A time quoted for this pipeline must meet all of these:
- it is a warm generation, not the first after load;
- the NPU is in turbo mode;
- nothing else is loading the CPU. The CPU shares the package power budget, and a busy
  CPU slows the NPU 1.2-1.6×.

A number measured under load says so.

**Measured 2026-09-27, native engine, quiet machine** (CPU load 3-5% before each run),
turbo, the study's prompts 0-1 and noise (`goldens_pipe_<R>\ids_i.npy`, `noise_i.npy`),
4 runs each:

| | 512² | 1024² |
|---|---:|---:|
| image, warm | 5.09-5.15 s | 13.36-13.42 s |
| text encoder | 0.64-0.65 s | 0.64-0.65 s |
| conditioning | 0.04 s | 0.04 s |
| one denoising step | 0.98-1.00 s | 2.85-2.88 s |
| VAE | 0.46 s | 1.22-1.28 s |
| first image after load | 5.12-5.14 s | 13.42 s |
| load (cached) | 5.3-5.4 s | 5.2-5.4 s |
| host CPU per image | 0.00-0.11 s | 0.00-0.06 s |

LPIPS against the bf16 CPU run: 0.19 / 0.10 (512²) and 0.33 / 0.15 (1024²), the images
recorded under OPEN-DIFFUSION-QUALITY.

**The same machine's iGPU, for comparison** (Radeon 890M, gfx1150; measured 2026-09-27
on the quiet machine, right before the NPU run above). This is the diffusers bf16
pipeline through PyTorch-ROCm (`torch 2.12.0+rocm7.14.1`), timed by
`utilities/dit-ref/igpu_bench.py`:

| | 512² | 1024² |
|---|---:|---:|
| image, warm | 20.05-20.45 s (6 runs) | 134.2 s (1 run) |
| text encoder | 1.30-1.36 s | 1.31 s |
| one denoising step | 4.46-4.53 s | 31.9 s |
| VAE | 0.66-0.71 s | 4.75 s |
| first image after load | 52 s | 193 s |
| host CPU per image | 21.7-22.7 s | 136 s |

- The NPU is 3.9× faster at 512² and 10× faster at 1024².
- The iGPU's LPIPS against the bf16 CPU run is 0.069 / 0.015 (512²). It is plain bf16,
  so it drifts less than the NPU.
- The iGPU has no fused attention on this build:
  - by default, flash and memory-efficient SDPA have no gfx1150 kernel;
  - with `TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1`, they fail to launch (`invalid
    argument`).
  - Attention therefore runs on the math path at ~0.5 TFLOPS. That is 1.35 s of each
    512² step and 14-17 s of each 1024² step.
- A bf16 4096³ GEMM on the iGPU runs 8.5 TFLOPS. At that rate for every FLOP, a step would
  take ~1.5 s at 512², still slower than the NPU's 1.0 s.
- The iGPU's host CPU time about equals its wall time. The ROCm runtime keeps a core
  busy for the whole image.

**Measured 2026-09-27, native engine, under load** (`src/open_diffusion`), turbo, 2
prompts × 3 warm runs each. **Another ~11-core CPU job (another session's) was
running**, so these are pessimistic:

| | 512² | 1024² |
|---|---:|---:|
| image, warm | 5.2-6.0 s (mean 5.6) | 13.5-15.9 s (mean 15.1) |
| text encoder | 0.65-0.80 s | 0.64-0.75 s |
| conditioning | 0.04-0.06 s | 0.04-0.06 s |
| one denoising step | 1.0-1.25 s | 2.9-3.5 s |
| VAE | 0.46-0.54 s | 1.27-1.46 s |
| first image after load | 5.7-6.3 s | 15.0-15.8 s |
| load (kernels + 7.5 GB weights, cached) | 8-9 s | 6-7 s |
| host CPU per image | 0.03-0.19 s | 0.03-0.11 s |

**Earlier the same day, pyxrt runner** (`generate.py`), with a different 12-core job
running. These are slower: Python dispatch, and more contention. They were pessimistic
too:
- the standalone attention benchmark ran 42.7 ms against its quiet 30.5 ms;
- `sgl_in` ran 68.7 ms against 59.4 ms.

| | 512² | 1024² |
|---|---:|---:|
| image, warm | 6.5-7.4 s | 20.0-20.9 s |
| text encoder | 0.76-0.89 s | 0.86-0.88 s |
| conditioning | 0.06 s | 0.07 s |
| 4 denoising steps | 5.1-5.8 s | 17.2-17.9 s |
| VAE | 0.60-0.67 s | 1.86-2.07 s |
| first image after load | 9.5-11 s | 29 s |
