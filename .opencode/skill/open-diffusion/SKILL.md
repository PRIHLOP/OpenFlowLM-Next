description: Build, run, verify and time FLUX.2 [klein] 4B text-to-image with every op on the XDNA2 NPU -- the whole-image schedule (open_kernels/klein_pipeline.py), the pyxrt runner (utilities/dit-chain/generate.py), the bundle exporter and the native engine (src/open_diffusion). Use when generating images on the NPU, changing the schedule or its buffer layout, adding a resolution or another klein-shaped model, checking image quality against the CPU reference, timing the pipeline, or debugging a hang / wrong image in it.

# FLUX.2 [klein] on the NPU: the whole image

Sources:
- `open_kernels/klein_pipeline.py`: the ONE schedule, which everything else follows:
  - buffers, and the ops in dispatch order (1050);
  - weight packing specs, the parameter table and the host setup.
- `open_kernels/export_dit_kernels.py`: builds every stream the schedule names, then
  `open_kernels/compose_elf.py` assembles the six sets into one full ELF per resolution:
  the native engine's one hardware context. The `full-elf-context` skill has how, and the
  traps.
- `utilities/dit-chain/generate.py`: the pyxrt runner, on the six sets' xclbin contexts
  in the build directory. It is the reference the engine is held to.
- `utilities/dit-chain/export_bundle.py`: the model directory (schedules, packed weights in
  one `weights.bin`, the embedding table), for `src/open_diffusion` (native,
  pixel-identical to generate.py: `specs/open-diffusion/tests/test_engine_matches_pyxrt.py`).
  `q4nx-build --open-diffusion` runs it.
- `src/open_diffusion/`: the engine; `prompt.cpp` (main build) templates and tokenizes;
  `src/src/image_command.hpp` is `oflm image`; `cli.cpp` is the standalone gate.
- Serving: `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits` (one reference; edits.md) in
  `src/server/rest_handler.cpp`; the request rules are `openai_compat::images_request()`.
  Spec: `specs/server-api/spec.md` SERVER-IMAGES-*; tests
  `specs/server-api/tests/test_images_api.py` (needs `oflm serve <chat model>`).
- The kernels have their own skills: `dit-gemm`, `dit-fa`, `dit-ew`, `dit-conv`.
- Spec: `specs/open-diffusion/spec.md`. Design: `.claude/plans/image-diffusion-phase6-engine.md`.

## Run it

```
. C:\dev\mlir-aie\iron_env.ps1
python open_kernels\export_dit_kernels.py --resolutions 512,1024 --out C:\dev\klein-kernels --jobs 6   # sets, then ELFs (~7 min cold)
python open_kernels\export_dit_kernels.py --out C:\dev\klein-kernels --install src\xclbins\FLUX.2-klein-4B-NPU2\open_kernels
python utilities\dit-chain\generate.py --kernels C:\dev\klein-kernels --pack-only          # ~8 GB, 5 min, once
python utilities\dit-chain\generate.py --kernels C:\dev\klein-kernels --size 512 --prompt "a red fox in snow" --out C:\dev\gen
```

The shipped path (what a user gets from `oflm image`):

```
cd utilities\q4nx-build
python -c "from q4nx.cli import main; main(['--open-diffusion','-i','black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B','-o','%OFLM_MODEL_PATH%\models\FLUX.2-klein-4B-NPU2','--pack-cache','C:\dev\klein-kernels\packed'])"
src\build-windows-vcpkg.cmd
src\out\oflm.exe image flux2-klein:4b "a red fox in fresh snow" -o fox.png
src\open_diffusion\build.cmd     # the standalone gate: --model <dir> --kernels <installed set> --ids ids.npy
```

- **Two directories, one layout hash.** The model directory (`bundle.json`, `config.json`)
  and the installed kernel set (`diffusion_kernels.json`) each carry
  `export_dit_kernels.layout_hash`: every stream spec plus `WEIGHT_FORMAT`. The engine
  refuses a mismatch by name. Change a stream spec or `pack_b` and both must be rebuilt;
  bump `WEIGHT_FORMAT` when only the packing changes.
- **Kernel search:** `OFLM_DIFFUSION_KERNELS_DIR`, then `<model>/open_kernels`, then
  `<root>/xclbins/FLUX.2-klein-4B-NPU2/open_kernels` per xclbins root (`find_kernels`).
- **`--install` copies only runtime files**: the two ELFs and their description (39 MB),
  after removing an earlier install's kernel-set files. Never ship `--out` itself: the
  installer copies `xclbins\` recursively, `build\` and `elf_build\` included.
- **`src\out\xclbins` is an `xcopy`** (`build-windows-vcpkg.cmd`) and never deletes. After a
  kernel-set format change, `--install` into it too, or `src\out\oflm.exe` finds a stale set.
  `src\build\xclbins` is a junction to `src\xclbins`.
- **The registry entry:** `model_info_entry.json` predicts the HF tree API's listing
  (`*.bin` and >= 10 MB files are LFS). After the upload to `Cyronius/FLUX.2-klein-4B-NPU2`,
  pull on a clean models directory: every file's hash is checked.
- **Tokens:** `specs/open-diffusion/tests/token_goldens.json` (from `klein_tokens.py
  --goldens`) pins oflm's prompt path to `klein_pipeline.token_ids`; the
  `open_diffusion_tokens` CTest runs it. A prompt may contain `<|endoftext|>` (the pad id):
  the engine takes the ids' length as given, never scans for the pad.

Run PowerShell scripts that take `--out` through a wrapper with no `param()` block. With
`[Parameter(ValueFromRemainingArguments)]`, `--out` binds to `-OutVariable`.

## Quality check (the gate)

```
C:\dev\ditref-venv\Scripts\python.exe utilities\dit-ref\capture_pipeline_inputs.py --size 512    # ids, noise, sched, temb, mod
python utilities\dit-chain\generate.py --kernels C:\dev\klein-kernels --size 512 --study C:\dev\ditref-out\goldens_pipe_512 --out <d> [--ctx-ref] --ref-latents C:\dev\ditref-out\goldens_vae_512
C:\dev\ditref-venv\Scripts\python.exe utilities\dit-ref\score_images.py <d> --test "{:02d}.png" --ref "{:02d}.png" --ref-dir C:\dev\ditref-out\klein_512_s4\bf16
```

Expect LPIPS ~0.107 for the full pipeline and ~0.044 with `--ctx-ref`. Look at the
images.
- Prompt 0 (the neon sign) and prompt 3 are chaotic: they swing 2× under any
  perturbation, so judge on the mean and on the images.
- Final-latent rel_fro against the bf16 run is 0.2-0.6. That is trajectory divergence,
  not a bug.

## What was learned getting here (don't re-derive it)

1. **Modulation order is fixed by one GEMM's columns.** All steps' modulation comes from
   one GEMM (M = steps padded to 512, N = 184,320).
   - Each run of 2-3 vectors a dit_ew op reads has its own 6-vector, 4096-aligned slot
     (`MOD_RUNS`), so a step's run is a sub-buffer view.
   - The last double block's res modulates for the single blocks.
   - The last single block's res applies norm_out, whose chunk order is (scale, shift).
2. **te_attn's valid_len is an RTP write.** The exporter diffs a probe build (`valid_len
   77`) and records the 32 words, one per core, in `fa/dit_fa.json` `patch`.
   - The pyxrt runner rewrites them per prompt.
   - The native engine can't: its control code is inside the ELF. compose_elf splits
     te_attn into 512 tiny heads (`fa:te_attn_vl<n>`, those 32 writes) plus one tail
     (`fa:te_attn`), and the engine runs the prompt length's head first.
   - **The study's `ids_<i>.npy` are padded to 512.** Hand them to the engine whole and it
     runs with valid_len 512: no mask, a different image. Pass the first n (generate.py's
     report says `tokens`).
3. **The text-encoder taps (hidden states 9/18/27) are a second res+RMSNorm pass**
   (`te_tap<k>`). Its residual output goes to CTX [512, 8192] at column 2560 k.
   - The 512 zero columns spill into the next slot, or past 7680.
   - ctx_emb reads CTX with lda 8192.
4. **Conditioning GEMMs cost ~0.009 LPIPS.** dit_gemm's bf16 accumulator puts the
   modulation vectors 2-3% from diffusers'. Check with `utilities/dit-chain` +
   `goldens_pipe_<R>/mod.npz`: read MOD after a cond-only run. A layout bug would be
   O(1).
5. **Every queued xrt::run must be waited on**, not just the last. A run never waited on
   keeps a stale state, and restarting it fails with "bad command state". Queued runs
   across two hardware contexts hang the array, so the pyxrt runner drains before every
   switch. The engine has one context, so it only drains at phase boundaries.
6. **Determinism is a check.** The same inputs must give the same pixels, run after run and
   Python vs native.
   - Nondeterminism means state carried in a buffer. Zero-bordered VAE buffers were one
     case (`dit-conv` skill, lesson 11).
   - Diff the final latents first to localize it.
7. **Kernel-set switches were the biggest fixed cost** (822 per image × ~2.1 ms, ~34% of
   512²). The native engine now runs one full-ELF context per resolution, with register
   reconfiguration at 0.3-0.7 ms: 5.2 → 3.7 s at 512², 13.5 → 12.0 s at 1024². Its price
   is that it needs high QoS priority to survive another process on the NPU (the
   `full-elf-context` skill). The pyxrt runner keeps six contexts.
8. **Timing is invalid while any CPU job runs.** The CPU shares the package power budget.
   A 12-core job made attention 42.7 ms against its quiet 30.5 ms.
   - Check `Get-Process` before quoting a number.
   - Keep `xrt-smi` in turbo.

## Serving (what was learned)

- **Swap by default, `--imagegen 1` to keep both.** An image request resets `auto_chat_engine`
  but keeps `current_model_tag`, so an omitted or same-named chat model reloads through
  `ensure_model_loaded`'s NeedsLoad path. `release_image_engine_for_chat()` is the other
  direction. llama3.2:1b plus the image engine fit the NPU together; with `--asr`/`--embed`
  too is not measured.
- **The engine takes the server's `xrt::device`** (`Engine(model, kernels, &npu_device_inst)`).
- **`XT` is overwritten by the text encoder** (the residual stream), so `set_tokens` runs
  before every image, not once per request.
- **Step counts:** the engine derives each arg's per-step stride from step 0 vs step 1 of
  the schedule (only `MOD` and `DT` move) and grows `DT` to fit 50 steps. For the bundle's
  count it writes the bundle's own `tf_/dt_` bytes: `schedule.hpp`'s features are within
  2^-8, not equal, because numpy's float32 `exp` is not correctly rounded.
- `open_diffusion_schedule` CTest holds `schedule.hpp` to the bundle; `openai_compat` holds
  `images_request()`.

## Adding a resolution

- `check_resolution`: (R/16)² must be a multiple of 512.
- Export with `--resolutions`, `--install` it, then rebuild the model directory (the
  layout hash changes) and add the size to `image_sizes` in `src/model_list.json`.
- New streams appear per R: DiT gemm/ew/fa, euler, x_emb/proj_out, and the VAE's.
- compose_elf makes the new size its own ELF from `klein_pipeline.plan(R)`'s streams. Keep
  each ELF to what its schedule runs: kernel creation walks all of an ELF's control code.
- Capture study inputs with `capture_pipeline_inputs.py --size R`.
